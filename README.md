# ЁЯЪй Parade!

Lightweight UI component story and documentation showcase for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).<br />
Is Storybook and Docz too bloated for you? I'm working on a simple alternative.

> тЪая╕П Pre-alpha: This is a proof-of-concept.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project is using itself for documentation.

## Roadmap
